//the following functions will be useful for solving more complicated functions! These were taken from previous exercises! You will also notice that I use some concepts from es6, although it is not absolutely necessary, it usually results in simpler and/or more eloquent functions.

// Write a function named isNegative that accepts a number and returns true or false based on whether the input is negative.

function isNegative(num) {
    return num < 0;
}

// Write a function named `isTen` that accepts a number and returns a boolean

function isTen(num) {
    return num === 10;
}

// Write a function named `double` that accepts a number and returns the number
// doubled.

function double(num) {
    return (num * 2);
}


//~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// write a function named remove3s that accepts and array of numbers and returns an array with all all of the same numbers except for 3




// write a function named sumAll that returns the sum of all numbers in an array




// once we have the sum of all numbers in an array we can use it for further math problems.




// write a function named countEvens that accepts an array of nuyms and returns the number of even numbers in the array.




// Write a function named totalSales that accepts an array of employee objects. Each object has a 'name' property and a 'sale' property. Return the total sales




//write a function named AsAndBs that accepts a string and returns a count of how many a's and b's is contains




// Write a function called StringLength that returns the length of a string, if the input is not a string, return false




//write a function that accepts a string and returns an object with the original string, the length of the string, as well as the number of a's and b's




// Write a function thataccepts an array or strings and returns an array of those words analyzaed similarly
